Xmms Gtk Playlist 2.0

by Chris Kuklewicz (chrisk at mit.edu)

New in version 2.0, it should compile both the xmms_gtk_playlist
helper application from version 1.0 and a new libgtkplaylist which
will be installed a General Xmms plugin.

This works with XMMS to provide searching of the playlist.

The COPYING file provides a copy of the modifed BSD license used.

Also, if you are reading this you might also be interested in an
another project to create a search helper (using QT v2) called Qbble :

Shameless Plug: Since Xmms uses a gtk main loop, there is a better "fit"
with xmms-gtk-playlist than a qt2.0 solution.
